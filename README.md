This Rust program shows modular arithmetic operations on the direct product of two cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m$. It contains functions to generate elements of the cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m$, compute their direct product, perform modular addition, and compute modular inverses.

## Features
- **Generation of Elements:** Create all elements of the cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m$.
- **Direct Product Computation:** Compute the Cartesian product $\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m$. This produces pairs that represent items in the direct product group.
-  **Addition in $\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m$:** Perform addition of two elements in the direct product group, with results taken modulo $n$ and $m$.
-  **Inverse Computation:** Calculate the inverse of an element in $\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m$.

  ## Installation

- To use this project, you need to have Rust installed on your machine.
- If Rust is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install it.
- After installing Rust, clone this repository or copy the code into a Rust project, Compile and run the code using cargo run.
## Usage
- You can change the values of $n$ and $m$ in the main function to work with different cyclic groups. Furthermore, the code can be modified to perform various functions or interact with user input.
- The program computes and displays the direct product of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m$, which are predefined in the code. It will also show the sum of two elements and the inverse of an element from the direct product group.
