This Rust program shows modular arithmetic operations on the direct product of two cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m$. It contains functions to generate elements of the cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m$, compute their direct product, perform modular addition, and compute modular inverses.

## Features
- **Generation of Elements:** Create all elements of the cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m$.
- **Direct Product Computation:** Compute the Cartesian product $\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m$. This produces pairs that represent items in the direct product group.
-  **Addition in $\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m$:** Perform addition of two elements in the direct product group, with results taken modulo $n$ and $m$.
-  **Inverse Computation:** Calculate the inverse of an element in $\mathbb{Z}_n\times \mathbb{Z}_m$.
